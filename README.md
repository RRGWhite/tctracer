## TCtracer
**TCtracer** is a tool that enables the establishment of traceability links between JUnit tests and test classes and their tested functions and classes.

### Usage
**TCtracer** requires dynamic information gathered by an instrumenting agent, **TCagent** .
Therefore, in order to use **TCtracer** one must first execute the test suite for the project-under-analysis, passing **TCagent** to the JVM via the -javaagent command line parameter.
